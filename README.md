Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student-related factors such as academic pressure, financial stress, sleep duration, study hours, and overall satisfaction. The goal is to understand how these variables influence student well-being and academic outcomes.
Using SQL for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, I created an interactive dashboard that provides clear, actionable insights from raw data.
ðŸ”¹ Objectives
To study the impact of academic pressure and financial stress on student count.
To analyze patterns in sleep duration and study hours.
To understand the relationship between study satisfaction and student count.
To demonstrate skills in SQL querying (data extraction, joins, aggregation) and Tableau dashboard design.
ðŸ”¹ Data Source
Dataset: Student survey dataset (simulated/collected).
Features analyzed:
Academic Pressure (AP)
Financial Stress (FS)
Sleep Duration (hours)
Study Hours (per day)
Study Satisfaction (SS)
Student Count (SC)
ðŸ”¹ Methodology
Data Preparation (SQL):
Imported raw dataset into SQL database.
Cleaned missing/duplicate records.
Performed aggregations to calculate student counts per category.
Joined relevant tables (if multiple datasets).
Visualization (Tableau):
Connected SQL-processed data with Tableau.
Designed interactive dashboard to display relationships across different student parameters.
Used bar charts, bubble charts, and area charts for better data storytelling.
ðŸ”¹ Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
Academic Pressure & Student Count â€“ Distribution of students across different academic pressure levels.
Financial Stress & Student Count â€“ Bubble chart showing the effect of financial stress on student numbers.
Study Satisfaction & Student Count â€“ Bar chart highlighting satisfaction trends.
Sleep Duration & Student Count â€“ Bubble chart representing student counts based on daily sleep duration.
Study Hours & Student Count â€“ Area chart analyzing how study hours vary with student count.
ðŸ”¹ Insights Gained
Students with moderate academic pressure form the largest group, while extreme pressure reduces student count.
Financial stress is a significant factor influencing student well-being.
Optimal sleep duration (7â€“8 hours) is common among most students.
Higher study satisfaction correlates with balanced study hours and less stress.
